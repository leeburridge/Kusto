=Kusto can use regular expressions=
This is a first take on using Kusto to filter a dataset

errcode
| where ecode matches regex "/\b15\b|\b80\b|\b1223\b/g"

This should filter where the field ecode is 15, 80 or 1223. Regex may need testing fully to confirm however on regexr.com it works as it should
